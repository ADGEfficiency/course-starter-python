# From zero to ines/course-starter-python

Course Starter python is a starter repo based on the course framework [Ines Montani](https://ines.io/) developed for her [online open source spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io/). Since creating this framework in April 2019, it has since become a useful tool and plateform for Data Scientists and Developpers to implement their own courses in a manner similar to other popular online Data science educational plateforms.
