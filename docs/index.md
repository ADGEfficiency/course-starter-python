# From Zero to ICSP (Ines Course Starter - Python)

Course Starter python is a starter repo based on the course framework [Ines Montani](https://ines.io/) developed for her [online open source spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io/). Since creating this framework in April 2019, it has since become a useful tool and plateform for Data Scientists and Devellopers alike to implement their own courses in a manner similar to other popular online Data science educational plateforms. 

This course gives the developer the versatility of a lecture slide type informational piece followed by multiple choice questions and coding exercises equiped with verification of the students submitted answers.

Ines Montani has created this framework using Gatsby and Reveal.js in the front-end and Binder and Docker in the back-end. This framework was made possible thanks to the useful JavaScript library [`Juniper`](https://github.com/ines/juniper) Ines created which can add interactive, editable and runnable code snippets to websites.

## What To Expect 

I hope that this thorough documentation will help you deploy, customize and troubleshoot your own Starter course. 

You will be working with different file types including `.md` (and potentially `.rmd`), `.json`, `.py` and `.txt`. 
You may need to know _some_ html for additional customization, however by no means in depth. 

let's get started. 

## Setup 

This tutorial will describe the steps to create a complete initial "Starter Course" with zero customization. From here we will then change, edit and add files to complete your desired unique course. 

### Install Gatsby 

This is a nightmare. 

download homebrew 

download node 
brew install nvm
npm install -g gatsby-cli
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-sharp
