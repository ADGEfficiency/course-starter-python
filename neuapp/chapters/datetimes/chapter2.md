<exercise id="1" title="Introduction" >

In the first section *Timezones*:

- understand how to use the `pytz` library, 
- create timezone aware datetimes with `localize`,
- convert timezones with `astimezone`,
- tzinfo, naive versus aware 

In the second section *Daylight Saving*:


## Motivations

Timezones are a modern day problem.

Our ability to communicate & travel over large distances means requires us to reference time all across the planet - past, present and future, in any location.

Daylight savings introduce more complexity to the timezone problem - a single location can have multiple timezones in a single year.

While timezones and daylight savings are complex, they are an unavoidable part of working with datetimes.  Mastering them is well within the capability of any data professional - hence this course ^^
