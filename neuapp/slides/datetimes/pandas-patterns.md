## Combine year, month and day in pandas to create a date

Imagine you have a dataset like the following:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({
  'year': [2020, 2020, 2021, 2025],
  'month': [2020, 2020, 2021, 2025],
  'day': [2, 4, 6, 8]
})
```

What is the best way to create a single datetime column?

## How select all values between two dates by year, month, day columns?

A common operation is to today's date in a "YYYY-MM-DD" format
